# Solution

1. Create a new repository on your chosen platform, following their provided instructions.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired location.
3. Create a new directory and move into it:
   ```
   mkdir DevOpsChallenge
   cd DevOpsChallenge
   ```
4. Create the sample files and add content to them using a text editor.
5. Initialize the local Git repository:
   ```
   git init
   ```
6. Add the sample files to the staging area:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
7. Commit the changes with an initial commit message:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
8. Link your local repository to the remote repository you created earlier:
   ```
   git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
   ```
9. Push the local repository to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```
10. Set up SSH keys for secure access to the remote repository according to the platform's documentation.

Remember that the exact commands and steps might vary depending on the platform you choose. Always refer to their documentation for specific instructions.

Great job on completing Day 1! This exercise has laid the foundation for efficient version control, a crucial aspect of the DevOps workflow. Tomorrow, we will dive deeper into Continuous Integration (CI) and learn how to automate builds and tests. Stay tuned!
